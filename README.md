How do I get set up?

    Create MySQL DB called test 
    username: root
    password: root
    
    script for creating and populating in ./src/main/resources/db

    If you are using IDE like Intellij Idea you must configure Tomcat or other servlet container. 
    The default web link is http://localhost:8080/users 
    The application is deployed at the root application context.
    No unit tests is provided
